# Syllabus For Session 1 - Git Basics

Another name for this session could be "Three Objects and Three Trees".
 
## Overview

We will learn git's data model, consisting of three objects.  We will learn git's local-change-management model, which manipulates three trees.  We will use git commands to examine the state of git objects on these trees, and move them back and forth.  Some of these commands may be familiar (e.g., 'git checkout', 'git add', 'git commit', 'git status', 'git diff') and some may not ('git reset', 'git diff \--staged').

## Prerequisites

Review [Prework](session-1-prework) for Session 1.

### Goals

1. Understand the git data model (__The Three Objects__) well enough to describe a git commit in terms of its objects.
1. Understand the local state of your latest changes well enough to move them between __The Three Trees__ with basic git commands such as 'git add', 'git commit', and 'git reset'.
 
### Objectives

By the end of session 1, students will be able to...

#### Explain these terms and concepts:
* sha
* content-addressable filesystem
* blob, tree, commit
* workspace, index, HEAD
* symbolic ref
 
#### Use these commands, and understand them in terms of the 3 objects/3 trees:
* git add
* git status
* git diff \[\--staged\]
* git commit
* git reset \[\--soft, \--mixed, \--hard \]
 
#### Identify and explain these components of a repo graph (as seen with "git log \--all \--decorate \--oneline \--graph"):
- HEAD
- master
- origin/master
- shas
- the lines along the left side
- branch/merge points

## Three Objects

Git is a brilliantly simple data model surrounded by a dense constellation of commands and options.  Once you know the model, you know how the graph should look.  Then you are equipped to find the command that does want you want.

- __Commit__ and its attributes
- __Tree__ and its attributes
- __Blob__ and its attributes

## Three Trees

The word "reset" is loaded with so many connotations that it is nearly meaningless.  For the purposes of this session, you can read "reset" as "set-current-branch-to-a-commit".  We'll explore how this works for managing local changes.

See [Reset Demystified](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Reset-Demystified){:target="_blank"}.

These are the three trees:

- HEAD - pointer to the current branch, which points to a commit
- Index - the place you add to; the staging area for commits
- Workspace - the files checked out on disk (not including the git repo itself - that would be too meta)
